# Diátaxis

[Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) is a way of thinking about and doing documentation.

It prescribes approaches to content, architecture and form that emerge from a systematic approach to understanding the needs of documentation users.

Diátaxis identifies four distinct needs, and four corresponding forms of documentation - tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference and explanation. It places them in a systematic relationship, and proposes that documentation should itself be organised around the structures of those needs.

## Tutorials (Learn)

Tutorials are lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of steps to complete a project of some kind.

**Tutorials are learning-oriented.**

A tutorial must help a beginner achieve basic competence with a product, so that they can go on to use the product for their own purposes.

A tutorial also needs to show the learner that they can be successful with the product - by having them do something both meaningful and attainable.

**A tutorial in other words is a lesson** - a lesson concerned with learning how rather than learning that, because it’s concerned with skill: practical, not theoretical knowledge.

Having completed a tutorial, the learner should be in a position to start to make sense of the rest of the documentation, and the product itself.

**For a product, a tutorial turns new learners into users.** An inadequate tutorial can prevent a project from acquiring new users.

## How-To Guides (Do Work)

How-to guides are directions that take the reader through the steps required to solve a real-world problem.

**How-to guides are goal-oriented.**

How-to guides can be thought of as recipes, directions that guide the reader through the steps to achieve a specific end.

Examples could be: how to calibrate the radar array; how to use fixtures in pytest; how to configure reconnection back-off policies. On the other hand, how to build a web application is not - that’s not addressing a specific goal or problem, it’s a vastly open-ended sphere of skill.

How-to guides matter not just because users need to be able to accomplish things: the list of how-to guides in your documentation **helps frame the picture of what your product can actually do**. A rich list of how-to guides is an encouraging suggestion of a product’s capabilities.

If they’re well-written and address the right subjects, you’re likely to find that how-to guides are the most-read sections of your documentation.

## Tutorials versus How-To Guides

Diátaxis insists that what matters in documentation is the **needs of the user**, and it’s by paying attention to this that we can correctly distinguish between tutorials and how-to guides.

Sometimes the user is at study, and sometimes the user is at work. Documentation has to serve both those needs.

**A tutorial serves the needs of the user who is at study.** Its obligation is to provide a successful learning experience.

**A how-to guide serves the needs of the user who is at work.** Its obligation is to help the user accomplish a task. These are completely different needs and obligations, and they are why the distinction between tutorials and how-guides matters: tutorials are learning-oriented, and how-to guides are task-oriented.

## Reference Documentation (Map)

Reference guides are technical descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it.

**Reference material is information-oriented.**

The only purpose of a reference guide is to describe, as succinctly as possible, and in an orderly way. Whereas the content of tutorials and how-to guides are led by needs of the user, reference material is led by the product it describes.

In the case of software, reference guides describe the software itself - **APIs, classes, functions and so on - and how to use them.**

Your users need reference material because they need truth and certainty - firm platforms on which to stand while they work. Good technical reference is essential to provide users with the confidence to do their work.

### Reference as Description

Reference material should be austere and to the point. One hardly reads reference material; one consults it.

There should be no doubt or ambiguity in reference; it should be wholly authoritative.

**Reference material is like a map.** A map tells you what you need to know about the territory, without having to go out and check the territory for yourself; a reference guide serves the same purpose for the product and its internal machinery.

Although reference should not attempt to show how to perform tasks, it can and often needs to include a description of how something works or the correct way to use it.

Some reference material (such as API documentation) can be generated automatically by the software it describes, which is a powerful way of ensuring that it remains faithfully accurate to the code.

## Explanation (Understand)

Explanation is discussion that clarifies and illuminates a particular topic.

**Explanation is understanding-oriented.**

Explanation clarifies, deepens and broadens the reader’s understanding of a subject.

It’s not concerned with what the user might be doing, like tutorials and how-to guides. It’s not a close-up view of the machinery, like reference material. It’s documentation that approaches a topic from a higher perspective, and from different angles.

This allows explanation to become discussion, a more relaxed, freer way to consider something. Explanation joins things together. It’s documentation that it makes sense to read while away from the product itself.
